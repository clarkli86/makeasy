h1. This is a template makefile for small-scale desktop/embedded C/C++ applications

The main features are:
# Common targets (application, clean, unittest, gcov)
# Placeholder variables for common settings includings CFLAGS, LDFLAGS
# Generate and include make dependencies (TODO)
# Support directories (TODO)
# Support different targets (linux_debug, linux_release, windows, etc) (TODO: include sub makefiles? How to generate targets? Use a json input file)
# Different folders for debug and release builds
